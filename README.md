# 🏏 IPL Win Probability Predictor

A Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the real-time winning probability of IPL teams during a match using historical IPL data.

This project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment using Streamlit to provide dynamic win probability predictions based on match conditions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application predicts the probability of the batting team winning a match based on:

- Batting Team
- Bowling Team
- Match City
- Target Score
- Current Score
- Overs Completed
- Wickets Lost
- Required Run Rate
- Current Run Rate

The model is trained on historical IPL match data and deployed as an interactive web application.
